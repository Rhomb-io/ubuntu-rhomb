------------------------------
Ubuntu setup for rhomb devices
------------------------------
This is pakcage to build and install ubuntu filesystem on rhomb devices.
-------------
Prerequisites
-------------
For ubuntu installation use SD card having atleast 16GB capacity.
To use ubuntu pakcage machine should have atleast 15GB free space available. 
------------------
Build Instructions
------------------
1) Run below command
   # sudo ./build.sh all
   This command will take little long for the first time run as it downloads
   all the packages and then compile. It will generated zImage (dtb appended )
   and ubuntu.tgz in "<ubuntu-rhomb>/output/images/".

   If user is using this package first time it is mandatory to run 
   "sudo ./build.sh all" command. 

2) To rebuild linux kernel.
   # sudo ./build.sh linux
   This command rebuild linux kernel with latest chagnes and install kernel
   image (zImage with dtb appended) in "<buidroot_rhomb>/output/images/".

3) To rebuild u-boot
   # sudo ./build.sh uboot
   This command rebuild uboot with latest chagnes and install uboot image
    in "<buidroot_rhomb>/output/images/".

4) To build ubuntu filesystem.
   # sudo ./build.sh ubuntu

5) To get help of the 'build.sh' script
   # sudo ./build.sh help

--------------------
Install instructions
--------------------
1) There is one more script 'prepare_sd.sh'. This scripts flashes all the required 
   binaries to boot from SD card having ubuntu filesystem. 
   run 'prepare_sd.sh' script:
   # sudo ./prepare_sd.sh <SD Reader's device file>
   example <SD Reader's device file> : sdb, mmcblk0, sdd, sdc etc
   Once SD card is prepared user need to set board for SD bootmode.
   Insert prepared SD card and power on board.

2) For EMMC flashing user need to first follow build instructions and boot
   from SD card as instructed in above step 1 of install instructions. Once
   board is booted from SD card user need to login. "odroid login: " prompt
   by entering
   user name : odroid
   password  : odroid

3) After that apply below commands.
   # cd /opt/
   # sudo tar -xzvf images.tgz --warning=no-timestamp
   # cd images
   # sudo ./emmc_fusing.sh mmcblk1
        (This script will ask user if "/dev/mmcblk1p1" already formated with
	ext4 filesystem as below)

        /dev/mmcblk1p1 contains a ext4 file system
                last mounted on / on Thu Jan  1 00:00:02 1970
        Proceed anyway? (y,N)
        Enter 'y' if it asked first time.
        For next time onwards user can enter 'N'
4) At the end of above command below messages will be printed
        eMMC flashed
        Power off the board
        Set emmc boot mode boot board
        Good luck!
5) User need to set board in EMMC bootmode to boot board from EMMC.
6) Once user set board in EMMC bootmode and power on board board will boot from eMMC

NOTE: In case of booting from eMMC we have seen that sometimes it failed to display GUI
on HDMI screen. In that case login into board and apply below commands. This is one time
command you won't face issue after that.

# sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
# sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm restart
